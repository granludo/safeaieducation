# Safe AI in Education Manifesto
version 0.1 29 august 2024

## Preamble
In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise to enhance learning experiences, streamline administrative tasks, and support both students and educators. However, with these advancements come significant responsibilities. The Safe AI in Education Manifesto establishes the foundational principles that ensure AI is deployed in educational settings in a manner that is ethical, secure, and aligned with the core objectives of education.

## Principle 1: Guaranteeing Confidentiality
We commit to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of all student data, including identities, roles, academic records, and interactions. AI systems must be designed and implemented with stringent security measures to protect student information. Educational institutions should either own and operate the technology stack or require strict privacy compliance from AI vendors, ensuring no data is exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Declaration:** We reject the use of free tools that require students to register with third-party services as a mandatory component of their education. Students should retain full control over their personal data, and no educational process should compromise this right.

## Principle 2: Alignment with Educational Strategies
AI tools must be in harmony with the educational strategies and IT governance of the institutions they serve. They should support learning objectives without introducing undue complexity or facilitating unethical practices such as cheating or plagiarism. AI should be a tool that enhances educational outcomes, not one that complicates the learning process.

**Declaration:** We recognize the dangers of using general-purpose AI tools that are not specifically designed for educational contexts. The complexity of such tools, along with the risk of misuse, undermines the educational process and increases cognitive load. We advocate for the use of AI systems that are tailored to fit the specific needs and goals of educational institutions.

## Principle 3: Alignment with Didactic Practices
The deployment of AI in education must be grounded in established didactic practices. Educators need to have a clear understanding of how AI tools will integrate with their instructional design and learning objectives. AI should support teaching methodologies rather than disrupt them.

**Declaration:** We emphasize the need for AI tools to be adaptable to various instructional designs. Whether through specialized interfaces or specific configurations, AI should be a seamless extension of the teaching process, providing support without imposing additional burdens on educators or students.

## Principle 4: Accuracy and Minimization of Errors
Accuracy is paramount in educational contexts. AI systems must prioritize delivering precise and relevant information, especially given the risks of hallucinations and errors inherent in current AI technologies. These risks can be mitigated by deploying AI in narrowly defined application contexts and ensuring that AI tools reference their sources, allowing users to verify the information provided.

**Declaration:** We demand rigorous quality assessments for AI tools used in education. The reliability of AI systems is non-negotiable, and continuous evaluation is necessary to maintain the integrity of the educational process.

## Principle 5: Comprehensive Interface and Behavior
AI systems must have interfaces that are transparent and easily understood by students and educators. The behavior of these systems should clearly communicate their intended use and limitations, avoiding any pretense of infallibility or omniscience.

**Declaration:** We advocate for AI tools that are designed with clarity and honesty at their core. These tools must explicitly convey their limitations and avoid presenting erroneous information with undue confidence. In doing so, they will support a learning environment where students can trust, but also critically assess, the AI's outputs.

## Conclusion
The integration of AI into education is inevitable and holds great potential. However, this integration must be guided by principles that prioritize the well-being, privacy, and educational success of students. The Safe AI in Education Manifesto is a commitment to these principles, ensuring that AI enhances the educational experience without compromising ethical standards or educational integrity.
